# Research Rationale
The impetus behind this research lies in the intricate interplay between socioeconomic factors and power plants. As the global energy landscape undergoes a transformative shift toward sustainability, it becomes paramount to understand how these changes might impact communities, particularly those situated in lower-income communities. The socio-spatial lens through which this study is conducted aims to unearth patterns of power plant distribution across North Carolina. With 100 counties and a total of 843 power plants consisting of 1190 generators (US EPA, 2021), the state's unique landscape offers a rich context for investigation. The overarching question is whether certain communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmentally impactful energy sources, framing the discourse within the realms of environmental justice and equity.

As a key aspect of this exploration, the research considers the connection between power plant location and emissions and various socioeconomic indicators, including but not limited to unemployment rates. This exploration is motivated by the awareness that power plants have often served as major employers in low-income areas (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2021). This research extends its focus beyond energy sources to examine the broader impacts of power plants on health and social vulnerability, and scrutinizes disparities in pollution exposure and associated health risks at a high level, using publicly available data. Through an exploration that encompasses various socioeconomic indicators, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the multifaceted impacts of power plants.

The following research questions are addressed:  
1. How does income impact power plant characteristics at the county level? \
2. Do power plant retirements have a significant impact on unemployment? \
3. Does publicly available data show a relationship between power generation and social vulnerability, health vulnerability, or environmental burden?

# Dataset Information
Data used in this analysis comes from a variety of sources. A brief overview of each source is outlined below and full citations can be found at the end of this report. More information on the metadata for each source can be found in the [Metadata folder](https://github.com/ssedar/CzarniakMichelSedar/tree/main/Data/Metadata) on github.


### Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)
The study utilizes the 2020 and 2021 eGRID provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to acquire essential power plant characteristics. This annually updated database offers comprehensive details on emissions, emission rates, generation, heat input, resource mix, location, and various other indicators. For the specific analyses undertaken in this research, key data elements employed included the plant Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, generation, nameplate capacity, and emissions by plant.

To process this dataset, the plant and generator sheets undergo individual modifications before being integrated. Notably, columns relevant to the analyses were selected, an additional column was introduced to consolidate state and county FIPS codes into a unified county FIPS code, and the overall dataset was filtered to North Carolina, exclusively. A parallel procedure is executed for the generator sheet before merging the two datasets using the unique ORISPL code.

It is important to highlight that although the most recent eGRID database available was from 2021, this version lacked historical generator retirement data. Consequently, the 2020 eGRID database is incorporated to facilitate the analysis of unemployment trends related to generator retirements.

### Economic Research Service Datasets: Median Household Income
To establish a nexus between power plants and socioeconomic factors, household income data is derived from data compiled by the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. This data includes metrics such as household income and poverty rates at the county level, with identification facilitated by the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Code. The preparation of this dataset involves the extraction of pertinent columns, specifically median household income, followed by integration with the initial eGRID dataframe. The unifying factor for this integration is the FIPS Code, which served as the common column linking the two datasets.

### Economic Research Service Datasets: Unemployment
As an additional facet of investigation, the analysis incorporates unemployment data obtained from the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. The dataset, spanning the years 2000 through 2021, comprises comprehensive information on the total labor force, the number of employed individuals, the number of unemployed individuals, and the unemployment rate. The data wrangling process for this dataset unfolds in two distinct stages. Initially, the columns of interest, specifically those pertaining to the unemployment rate, are  selected. Following this, the identified columns undergo appropriate conversions to their intended data types before being merged with the existing dataset, utilizing the county FIPS code as the linking identifier.

The subsequent phase of data wrangling introduces additional steps specifically tailored for conducting regression analyses between generator retirements and unemployment rates. To facilitate this analysis, the code executes a transposition of the data. This transformation presents North Carolina county unemployment rates by year in a more streamlined format, allocating a dedicated column for each year. 

### Social Vulnerability Index 
2020 data from the U.S. CDC on key vulnerability criteria including socioeconomic status, household characteristics, racial & ethnic minority status, and house type & transportation. There are four theme variables that contribute to the Overall Vulnerability index value: Socioeconomic Status (RPL_THEME1), Household Characteristics (RPL_THEME2), Racial & Ethnic Minority Status (RPL_THEME3), and Housing Type & Transportation (RPL_THEME4). The variables that contribute to each of these themes are estimated using the American Community Survey (ACS), 2016-2020 (5-year data). U.S. tracts are ranked based on percentiles. Percentile ranking values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater vulnerability. Percentile ranks are available for the 16 individual variables that feed into the four themes, the four themes, and the overall vulnerability position.

Initially, this data set was chosen because it contains socioeconomic information at the county and tract level that was not available for 2020 in other sources we reviewed. Once we began to explore the dataset, and learned it contained variables we did not previously know were publicly available at this resolution, we chose to continue working with it beyond just the unemployment and income information we were initially seeking, and expanded to consider relationships between the broader set of variables it uses.

### Environmental Justice Index 
2022 report published by the U.S. CDC on environmental burden, social vulnerability, and health vulnerability indicators. This work builds on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s EJSCREEN. The indicators (social vulnerability, environmental burden, health vulnerability, and the variables that contribute to each of them) were selected based on a literature review conducted between December 2020 and December 2021. The Environmental Justice Index describes itself as "the first national, place-based tool designed to measure the cumulative impacts of environmental burden through the lends of human health and health equity." 

After learning about the Social Vulnerability Index, we continued exploring information available on the CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry site and, upon finding the EJI, were compelled to explore whether we might test hypotheses we had that generation and emissions from power plants would be correlated with increased environmental burden and health vulnerability within the year of 2021 in North Carolina, specifically. It is crucial to note that the EJI, like any tool produced for the national scale, has limitations baked into the resolution at which it provides information. We believe it is important to highlight from their data documentation, that "injustice occurs locally. High-level tools such as the EJI cannot capture all social, environmental, or health issues that a community may face." Detail on limitations and considerations can be found on page 7 of the EJI data documentation in the [Metadata folder](https://github.com/ssedar/CzarniakMichelSedar/tree/main/Data/Metadata) on github.

### Spatial Data
2020 data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry/ Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program is utilized for visualizations of data at the county level.

# Data Wrangling
The initial step in our research, once loaded, was data wrangling on the eGRID, unemployment, and income datasets. Data wrangling, or the process of transforming raw data, was a crucial step in this research, particularly due to the diverse nature of the datasets. For the eGRID dataset, the code selects specific columns related to power plant information in North Carolina, converts certain columns to numeric format, and then combines the generator and plant data based on a common identifier. Duplicate columns are removed, resulting in the plant_gen_data dataframe. The code then proceeds to handle the unemployment dataset, selecting relevant columns covering the years 2002-2022 and merging it with the plant_gen_data dataframe using the FIPS code as a key. Similarly, the income dataset is processed by selecting specific columns, and the final step involves merging this income data with the previously created dataframe. The resulting dataset, named processed_data, contains information on power plants, unemployment rates, and income data, and the column names are displayed at the end of the code. The social vulnerability index and environmental justice datasets are wrangled within the context of Question 3.

# Exploratory Analysis
This analysis initiates data exploration and visualization for the processed_data dataframe, focusing on fuel types, income, and electricity generation in North Carolina. Figure 1 generates a pie chart to illustrate the percentage makeup of primary fuel types in North Carolina based on total annual generation. Subsequently, the scatter plot in Figure 2 depicts the relationship between median household income and total plant annual generation, with points colored by fuel type. The exploratory analysis further drills down to scatter plots excluding nuclear data and for a selected set of fuel types (COAL, SOLAR, OIL, WIND, GAS). Additionally, stacked bar plots in Figures 5 and 6  visualize the total annual generation by fuel type and county, and for better clarity, separate plots are created for the top 10 and bottom 10 counties based on median household income. These visualizations help explore and understand the relationships between fuel types, income levels, and electricity generation in different counties of North Carolina.

We then created initial maps to better understand the landscape of North Carolina in terms of socioeconomic status and geographic distribution of power plants. Figure 7 below shows the mapping of power plants across the state and helped us to visualize the concentration of power plants across the state. Figure 8 maps the nameplate capacity of those power plants by county. We noticed that multiple counties, especially Richmond county, stood out as having a high concentration of capacity. Figure 9 demonstrates a heat map of the percentage of each county's population living in poverty as of 2021. Richmond county is once again a clear visual outlier on this map.

Additionally, we explored power plant emissions geographically as a final stage of our exploratory analysis. Figures 10-13 demonstrate the aggregated power plant emissions per county in 2021 for CO2, NOx, SO2, and CH4 respectively. Unfortunately eGrid did not provide data for Mercury (Hg) in 2021 so that was not analyzed. CH4 is provided in lbs while CO2, NOx, and SO2 are in short tons. For CO2 emissions, Richmond county stood out. For NOx emissions, Catawba county stood out. For SO2 emissions, Catawba, Haywood, and Person counties stood out. For CH4 emissions, Catawba and Person counties stood out.

As exploratory work into the dimensions of social vulnerability, environmental burden, and health vulnerability in relation to generation and emissions across power plants in North Carolina, tests for normality were conducted on the overall index value for each of the aggregated themes (SVI, EBM, HVM). The distribution of the variables corresponding to these three overall themes of interest can be seen in Figures 14-16.

As the last set of geographic explorations, three maps were created. The first was a map of NC power plants overlaid on tract boundaries to ensure that the matching of tracts to power plants for based on spatial features for Q3 analyses was successful (see Figure 17). The second highlights tracts that contain power plants--one level deeper than county resolution, for comparison (see Figure 18). The third maps asthma prevalence across NC tracts, as a visual grounding point in relation to Q3 analyses, given that the emissions considered in this project are known to have respiratory effects in humans (see Figure 19).

#   Question 1: How does income impact power plant characteristics at the county level?

### Null Hypothesis: The economic status of a community does not bear a statistically significant impact on the features of its power infrastructure.

This analysis begins by examining the impact that income has on various power plant characteristics. This first analysis uses income as the highest-level socioeconomic indicator, as income often dictates an array of follow-on indicators. Several regressions are conducted including the impact of income on the fuel type (differentiating between clean and dirty sources), number of plants, and nameplate capacity. 

Examining only the impact of income on coal plants, the estimated coefficient is approximately -134.6. This suggests that for each one-unit increase in income, the predicted value of coal generation decreases by approximately 134.6 MWh. The coefficient's p-value (0.1049) is greater than 0.05, indicating that it is not statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level. Furthermore, the R^2 suggests that only about 13.24% of the variability in coal generation is explained by income. Figure 20 below visualizes this relationship.

```{r IncomeAndFuel,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,error=FALSE}

#Coal linear regression
coal_data <- subset(processed_data, PLFUELCT == "COAL")
linear_model_coal <- lm(PLNGENAN ~ MEDHHINC_2021, data = coal_data)

summary_table <- summary(linear_model_coal)$coef[-1, ]

knitr::kable(summary_table, format = "html", caption = "Linear Regression Results - Median Income Impact on Coal Generation")


```

##### Figure 20: Relationship of median household income ($) on coal generation (MWh) in 2021 by county.{-}

  labs(title = "County Income and Coal Generation",
       x = "Median Household Income ($)",
       y = "Coal Generation (MWh)")
print(scatter_coal)
```

The linear regression shown in Figure 21 below suggests that there might be a relationship between income and solar generation. The statistically significant p-value (0.04707) indicates that there is evidence to suggest that an increase in median household income is associated with a decrease in the predicted value of solar generation However, it's important to note that the explained variance is quite low (about 0.56%), and so other factors not included in the model likely contribute to the variability in generation for solar.

---

```{r Solar,echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

#Solar linear regression
solar_data <- subset(processed_data, PLFUELCT == "SOLAR")
linear_model_solar <- lm(PLNGENAN ~ MEDHHINC_2021, data = solar_data)

summary_table_solar <- summary(linear_model_solar)$coef[-1, ]

knitr::kable(summary_table_solar, format = "html", caption = "Linear Regression Results - Median Income Impact on Solar Generation")

```

  labs(title = "County Income and Solar Generation",
       x = "Median Household Income ($)",
       y = "Solar Generation (MWh)")
print(scatter_solar)
```

The next stage of analysis examined if there was a relationship between the quantity of generators and median household income. The linear regression results indicate that median household income does not show a statistically significant association with the number of plants. The coefficient is estimated to be -0.0000786, with a standard error of 0.0000922, a t-value of -0.85, and a p-value of 0.3962. This suggests that, based on the available data, changes in median household income do not appear to be statistically linked to variations in the number of plants. Figure 22 below illustrates this relationship.

As a last step toward answering Question 1, an analysis was conducted on whether the average nameplate capacity of plants in a county is related to median household income across the data set in use, given that power plants differ in size. The linear regression on this relationship yields a coefficient of 0.0019239, accompanied by a standard error of 0.0023465. This implies that, theoretically, an increase in median household income is associated with a slight corresponding increase in Nameplate Capacity. However, the non-significant p-value of 0.4145 means we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and the observed association between median household income and Nameplate Capacity may be coincidental. Figure 23 below demonstrates this relationship.

## Summary
This study's initial inquiry sought to uncover how income, a significant socioeconomic indicator, relates to power plant characteristics. The investigation focused on the fuel type, the number, and the total nameplate capacity of power plants, each representing distinct dimensions of interest. Although the study did not produce definitive and statistically significant results regarding the influence of income on the number of power plants or nameplate capacity, it is suggested that this may be due to the complexity of the energy landscape. While one might expect lower generation capacity and fewer power plants in wealthier areas due to potential opposition, it is crucial to consider that energy consumption is often linked to a higher standard of living. Consequently, having generation capacity in higher-income areas may be necessary to meet the increased demand. Although this aspect of the exploration did not yield statistically significant results, it is noteworthy that the type of fuel generation, specifically solar, displayed some significance. The analysis indicated that an increase in median household income is associated with a decrease in solar generation. However, it is important to recognize that, despite being statistically significant, the coefficient of determination (r2) suggests that the explained variance is quite modest, standing at only 0.56%.

#   Question 2: Do power plant retirements have a significant impact on unemployment?

### Null Hypothesis: The retirement of power plant generators does not have an impact on unemployment rates in the counties in which they are located.

The primary motivation behind this analysis is to delve into the nuanced equilibrium inherent in a just energy transition. The imperative of shifting energy fuel sources from carbon-intensive to fossil fuel-free must be achieved without detriment to communities. In this examination, we initially pinpoint counties in North Carolina with the highest and lowest numbers of retirements, comparing them to their respective unemployment rates over time. To conduct a more pointed analysis, a statistical examination is performed on a specific county of interest.

Power plant retirements were analyzed (using data contained in the 2020 eGRID dataset) to identify which counties had the most number of retired power plants. The full selection of power plants with historical retirements can be seen in Figure 24. Counties with no retirements were also subsequently selected to provide a comparison.

Based on the dataset above, FIPS Code 37159 (Rowan) and 37191 (Wayne) each have the highest number of retirements at 7 rows. FIPS Code 37023  (Burke) 37041 (Chowan) 37049  (Craven) 37063 (Durham) 37067 (Forsyth) 37069 (Franklin) 37125 (Moore) each have 1 row.

In this analysis, counties experiencing both high (blue) and low (green) numbers of generator retirements, such as Rowan and Wayne (high retirements) and Burke and Craven (low retirements), are singled out. The objective is to investigate whether fluctuations in unemployment rates are influenced by generator retirements or if the rates exhibit similar trends irrespective of such retirements. Through this exploratory analysis, the goal is to discern any distinctive patterns in unemployment dynamics. Given that the plot in Figure 25 below shows instances in which the unemployment rates do not follow the hypothesized pattern, another variable was chosen for statistical analysis.

#[REMOVIG NARRATIVE FOR THE SUMMARY SINCE COMMENTED OUT RESULTS] Contrary to the initial hypothesis, this regression indicates that for each MW increase in retired nameplate capacity, the unemployment rate unemployment rate in Rowan is expected to decrease by approximately 0.02428 percentage points. The p-value is greater than 0.05, but given that it is only marginally higher (at 0.0619) we can theoretically interpret there to be a weak relationship. It must also be understood that the sample size is small and therefore we would need much more data for any reliable conclusions. The Multiple R-squared value of 0.5346 represents the proportion of the variance in the response variable (Rowan UE (%)) that can be explained by the predictor variable retired nameplate capacity (MW).

## Summary
The examination of the impact resulting from the retirement of power plant generators failed to produce definitive results; nevertheless, it contributes to the expanding field of advocating for an environmental justice perspective. This research goes beyond the reliance on the reduction of tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in emissions as a measure of the energy transition's success. It underscores the importance of adopting a holistic approach to key performance indicators, particularly given that large power plants are often situated in rural areas where communities heavily depend on utilities for employment (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2021). The analytical methodology adheres to best practices, incorporating counties with varying numbers of retirements to control for factors external to the retirements themselves. Additionally, the analysis delves into the actual nameplate capacity of retired assets, recognizing the plausible implication that a smaller capacity may employ fewer individuals compared to a larger plant. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, the findings reveal a statistically significant relationship, wherein each megawatt increase in retired nameplate capacity is associated with a marginal decrease in the unemployment rate. However, the inherent data limitations within this relatively small sample size require cautious interpretation. It is crucial to acknowledge that while this analysis falls short of providing conclusive results, it serves as a foundation for further exploration in subsequent analyses and environmental justice research.

#   Question 3: Does publicly available data show a relationship between power generation and social vulnerability, health vulnerability, or environmental burden?

###  Null hypothesis: There is no relationship between power plant distribution and social vulnerability, health vulnerability, or environmental burden.

Having explored two major socioeconomic dimensions in relation to total annual generation, the following sections expand upon income and unemployment to consider social vulnerability, environmental burden, and health vulnerability as the final topics in scope for this project's learning objectives.

#### Sub-question: Does publicly available data show a relationship between power generation and social vulnerability?

A set of analyses was conducted to briefly explore whether there is a significant relationship between power plants and the social vulnerability index (SVI), more broadly. A linear regression of SVI themes on total annual generation by county generated results summarized in Table 7.1. 

```{r County SVI and Total Power Generation lm}

#Selecting columns of interest:
SVI_county<-SVI_county_raw %>% select(ST_ABBR, STCNTY, COUNTY, FIPS, LOCATION, 
                                      RPL_THEMES, RPL_THEME1, RPL_THEME2, 
                                      RPL_THEME3, RPL_THEME4)

#Exporting to CSV:
#write.csv(SVI_county,'Data/Processed/SVI_County_Processed.csv', row.names=FALSE)

#Calculate sum of generation by county
Total_Generation_County <-plant_gen_data %>%
  group_by(CNTYNAME)%>%
  summarize(Total_Generation = sum(PLNGENAN))

#Merge SVI and total generation by county data
Generation_SVI <-merge(x = Total_Generation_County,
                           y = SVI_county, 
                           by.x = 'CNTYNAME', 
                           by.y = 'COUNTY' )

#Run regression to determine if there is a relationship
Generation_County_lm <- lm(Total_Generation ~ RPL_THEMES, data=Generation_SVI)
#Residual standard error: 14690000 on 74 degrees of freedom
# Multiple R-squared:  0.005408,	Adjusted R-squared:  -0.008033 
# F-statistic: 0.4023 on 1 and 74 DF,  p-value: 0.5278
# All coefficient p values are > .05

```

Examining the positive coefficient of 3643958 alone suggested that an increase in the overall SVI aggregated theme (RPL_THEMES) leads to an increase in generation. However, the multiple R-squared value was very small (0.005408), signaling that this model does not fit the data well; with an R-squared so low, RPL Themes could only explain 0.5% of total generation by county across North Carolina in 2021. Ultimately, the p-value was not statistically significant (0.5278 > .05). The null hypothesis that there is no relationship between generation by county and RPL Themes in North Carolina in 2021 therefore could not be rejected. As apparent in Figure 26, at the county level across North Carolina in 2021, percentile rank for the Social Vulnerability Index across themes cannot be concluded to have a significant relationship to total power generation within this dataset.

#### Sub-question: Does publicly available data show a relationship between power generation and environmental burden?

Given that power plants have historically made up a major stationary point source of air pollution including, for example, including SO2 and NO2, and given that both SO2 and NOx can contribute to the formation of atmospheric ozone and particulate matter, the relationship between power plant generation and emissions and the environmental burden module (EBM) was explored next. First, a single linear regression was run to examine whether the overall environmental burden module, RPL_EBM (percentile rank), could be at all explained by total generation per tract. Generation did not ultimately perform as a significant explanatory variable of RPL_EBM; the p-value of 0.93 was well above the 0.05 threshold for significance, and the R-squared value was very low (R-squared was 0.000025) as seen in Table 7.2.

Another linear regression run on nameplate capacity (maximum possible generation) returned an R-squared of .00027 and a p-value of 0.77, meaning nameplate capacity could not be considered a worthwhile explanatory variable to explore for the overall environmental burden module either. Ultimately, these analyses were insufficient to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between environmental burden and nameplate capacity, or power generation by tract. An existing relationship cannot be concluded. The lack of clear relationship is demonstrated in Figure 27 below.

#### Sub-question: Does publicly available data show a relationship between power generation and human health vulnerability?

As the last high-level, aggregated theme index value to test in order to answer Question 3, analyses were conducted to test whether a statistically significant relationship could be determined between the health vulnerability module (HVM) and total power generation (actual or maximum possible). As mentioned in the Exploratory Analysis section and illustrated in Figure 16, health vulnerability as a variable exists in this data set at values of 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 (percentile rank). The specific methodology for calculating Health Vulnerability can be found on page 16 of the EJI data documentation in the 'Metadata' folder. Treating the variable as continuous proved unhelpful toward rejecting a null hypothesis that there is no relationship between tract-level HVM and total generation per tract (see Figure 28 for a visual representation of the linear regression treating RPL_HVM as continuous), therefore a series of one-way ANOVA analyses followed in which the variable was treated as categorical. The objective was to see if total generation per tract (treated as the factor) is meaningfully different across percentile ranks of HVM (RPL_HVM, treated as the levels) by testing if the mean generation is equal across all percentile rank categories. It is important to note that the percentile ranks do not have equal sample sizes and so we cannot assume totally normal distribution (as seen in Figure 16). The mean RPL_HVN across tracts is 0.56 for the data relevant to this project.

Bartlett's test was run to check the null hypothesis that the variance at each of the percentile ranks is the same, and yielded a K-squared of 237.49 with 5 degrees of freedom and a p-value < 2.2e-16. ANOVA (function 'aov') was then run on tract generation and RPL_HVM (see Figure 29 below), yielding a p-value well above 0.05 (0.385). The null hypothesis that the mean of generation is the same across percentile ranks therefore could not be rejected. Lastly, a Tukey HSD test was conducted to examine the differences between pairs of percentile ranks, but every p-value generated was above 0.05.

Across regression tests run on the health vulnerability index value percentile rank (RPL_HVM) and total annual generation by tract, R-squared values were low and p-values were high. The regression results from this data and set of analyses are not sufficient to suggest that total generation can explain RPL_HVM with any significance. The analysis was insufficient to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between health vulnerability and total generation by tract in our dataset. At the tract level across North Carolina in 2021, a relationship cannot be determined between percentile rank for Health Vulnerability and total power generation.


## Summary
This study used data from CDC's Social Vulnerability (county resolution) and Environmental Justice (tract resolution) Indices to test hypotheses that greater generation by power plants is correlated with elevated percentile ranks on social vulnerability, environmental burden, and health vulnerability modules as defined by the CDC. The CDC documentation reminds us that "a percentile ranking represents the proportion of tracts (or counties) that are equal to or lower than a tract of interest in environmental burden. For example, a EJI ranking of 0.85 signifies that 85% of tracts in the nation likely experience less severe cumulative impacts from environmental burden than the tract of interest, and that 15% of tracts in the nation likely experience more severe cumulative impacts from environmental burden" (https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/eji/faq_eji.html). Analyses did not yield results that allow us to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between power plant distribution and social vulnerability, health vulnerability, or environmental burden.
